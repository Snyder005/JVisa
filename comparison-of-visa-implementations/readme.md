# Comparison of VISA implementations

I played around with four VISA implementations and recorded my findings. I mostly looked at the UI design and how nice I thought they would be to use in the real world. I didn't put them through any rigorous testing.

Unless you have reason not to, you should probably just install NI-VISA.

The four implementations:

* [Keysight](keysight)
* [National Instruments](national-instruments)
* [Rohde & Schwarz](rohde-and-schwarz)
* [Tektronix](tektronix)

## What's inside?

[According](https://www.tek.com/support/faqs/what-tekvisa-and-how-can-i-use-it-communicate-and-control-my-instrument) to Tektronix,

>Each VISA implementation is comprised of a communications driver, a USBTMC driver (USB Test and Measurement Class driver), a VISA software library and documentation, an instrument connection manager, an instrument communication tool, and an instrument communication logger.

## Multiple VISA implementations installed at the same time

Not recommended! It's possible but complicated. Here are two links to get you started.
